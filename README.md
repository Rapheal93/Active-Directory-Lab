# Active Directory Lab

## Objective
Creating and utilizing an Active Directory (AD) lab for simulating MITRE attack techniques involves setting up a controlled environment to mimic a real-world network infrastructure. In this lab, administrators can deploy various Windows servers and workstations configured with Active Directory services. Kali was using to genetrate any MITRE technique by using the crowbar tool and Splunk server was used to show attacks on the environment. By combining Kali Linux for attack simulation and Splunk for security monitoring, administrators and security professionals can effectively detect, analyze, and respond to simulated attacks within the Active Directory lab environment.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Splunk Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Crowbar Attack tool for brute force domain user accounts.
- Atomic Red Team to generate MITRE attack techniques.
